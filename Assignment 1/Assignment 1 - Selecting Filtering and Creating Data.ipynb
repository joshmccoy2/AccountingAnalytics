    "Use this notebook perform the following analyses using Python code and the **2018** compustat file. For the following questions, please write your answers to each question in the Canvas textbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code down below should support the answers you indicated; the code should be in an easy to follow format with comments to indicate what question you are trying to answer and what your code is accomplishing. You can also use MarkDown cells if you prefer that over commenting (you can read the tips on how to create markdown cells at the bottom of this file if you wish).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you finish the analyses, please **make sure every cell is executed and all the returning results are presented**. Then you can save the file and submit it to Canvas by uploading it to the textbox like our first in-class assignment. **Each group only has to submit one file but everyone should make sure they are able to write and run the code.**\n",

    "    - How many observations are there? (1 point)\n",
    "    - How many variables are there? (1 point)\n",
    "    - What are the names of those variables? (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Now for Q2 and Q3, we will be performing an analysis about General Motors Co. (GM) to see whether it outperformed its industry during 2018. First, we need to find the SIC industry code for General Motors Co. (tic == 'GM'). **What is the SIC industry code for GM?** (2 points)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- 3. (6 points) Since performance is a construct (i.e., a concept), we pick two common measures that capture performance: Return on Equity and Asset Turnover Ratio. Calculate these two measures using the definition below and answer: did GM outperform its industry **average** (mean) in fiscal year 2018 for each of the following two measures?\n",
    "    - Return on Equity, ROE: (net income /  total equity)\n",
    "    - Asset turnover ratio: (revenue / total assets)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *hints:*\n",
    "    - *the only command we know so far that gives us an average is describe*\n",
    "    - *Once you find GM's industry code, how can we limit our dataframe to just companies with the same SIC code (including GM)? Then, how can we find the average of our new variables?*\n",
    "    - *You should include GM in the industry average.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember to specify your answers in the textbox below and then upload your saved and executed Jupyter Notebook to the Canvas textbox to support your answers (14 points)**"
